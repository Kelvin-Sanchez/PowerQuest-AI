# PowerQuest-AI
This project is on hold since I have had limited time to work on it. Needs heavy work to clean up and I left it in a slightly broken state as it only plays 1 player mode. I wanted to combine forensic techniques along with my exploration of machine learning. Q-learning models are relatively simple to implement so I decided to chose this as a starting point. 

Q learning model aimed at playing Power Quest for GBC. I expected most of the memory addresses to be defined in some public github, but I could not find it. Worse yet even GameShark codes are now difficult to find, which are ultimately what I used as a starting point. If you would like to see what I have discovered please use the link below. I request if you find any error to please send me a message so I can fix it.
